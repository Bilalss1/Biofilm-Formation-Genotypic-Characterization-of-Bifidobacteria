# Biofilm-Formation-Genotypic-Characterization-of-Bifidobacteria
A research project investigating whether Bifidobacterium strains from commercial yoghurt and probiotic supplements possess the ability to form beneficial biofilms and carry genes associated with that trait. Completed as part of an MSc project and later published in a peer-reviewed journal.

**📌 Abstract**

Biofilms are structured microbial communities that allow bacteria to survive longer and compete against pathogens. This study **isolated Bifidobacteria** from commercial yoghurt products and probiotic supplements in the **UK** to determine their ability to **form biofilms** and whether they carry genetic markers linked to this behaviour.
Isolates were identified using selective media, Gram staining, biochemical tests and a RapID ANA II system. Biofilm formation was quantified using the crystal violet microtiter plate assay and compared with known pathogenic biofilm-forming organisms, including **S. aureus (MRSA)**, **P. aeruginosa**, **E. coli**, **Listeria monocytogenes** and others.
**Genetic characterisation** was performed using **ITS-PCR** (16S–23S rDNA intergenic spacer region) followed by **gel electrophoresis** to confirm species-specific bands.
This study supports the idea that food-derived Bifidobacteria can form protective and beneficial biofilms, helping to improve gut colonization and reduce infection risk. These findings provide important groundwork for future wet-lab validation and for improving the functional design of probiotic foods and therapeutics.
